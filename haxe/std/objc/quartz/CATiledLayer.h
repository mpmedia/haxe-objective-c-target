/* This is a subclass of CALayer providing a way to asynchronously
 * provide tiles of the layer's content, potentially cached at multiple
 * levels of detail.
 *
 * As more data is required by the renderer, the layer's
 * -drawInContext: method is called on one or more background threads
 * to supply the drawing operations to fill in one tile of data. The
 * clip bounds and CTM of the drawing context can be used to determine
 * the bounds and resolution of the tile being requested.
 *
 * Regions of the layer may be invalidated using the usual
 * -setNeedsDisplayInRect: method. However update will be asynchronous,
 * i.e. the next display update will most likely not contain the
 * changes, but a future update will.
 *
 * Note: do not attempt to directly modify the `contents' property of
 * an CATiledLayer object - doing so will effectively turn it into a
 * regular CALayer. */
